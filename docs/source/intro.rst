This script forms part of the Threat Intelligence toolkit whose aim is to 
provide demonstration scripts for BloxOne ThreatDefense. These can be used
for API demonstrations, or help to simplify PoCs for Threat Intelligence, 
demonstrating the value of TIDE and our threat intel offerings.

The tide_data_feed.py script is designed to provide a simple demonstration of
generating a CSV export from TIDE 'active state' data.

This documentation assumes that you have python3 installed and are familiar with 
both the Unix command line, files and the use of pip/pip3 to install any 
appropriate modules.
